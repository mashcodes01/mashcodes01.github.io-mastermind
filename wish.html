          <h1>Happy Birthday Mastermind!</h1>
          <p>I am extremely sorry that I forgot your birthday. I don't even know today's date.Please pardon me. Since the beginning of my school life, I got many friends. I lost many of them, but I don't care. Simply because they don't care about me. But I got a friend at the beginning of my college life who cares for me most. I never expected that I will find such a type of friend. Sometimes I feel like I got a brother who cares for his brother. Yes, we knew each other after 8 years but our brotherhood will last forever.  Happy birthday, brother!
            We can't predict our future. We don't know where we will end up but no matter what happens our brotherhood will last forever. You have a great future brother. You don't need to be worried about your future. Just concentrate on your studies and goals. And also keep your accounts and passwords safe.
